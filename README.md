# web-data-protection-in-germany-fact-sheet
This is a page with a fact sheet covering major info-points to protect your web-related data when located in Germany. 

Hi again!

<b>Why this fact sheet is here?</b></br>
As part of the bootcamp in marketing analytics we had one module on User Privacy and Data Protection. To have a well-structured overview of privacy-related matters, in particular legal aspects of user data collection and processing I created a fact sheet you might use for informational purposes.

# web-data-protection-in-germany-factsheet
This is a page with a factsheet covering major info-points to protect your web-related data when located in Germany. 

Hi again!

<b>Why this factsheet is here?</b></br>
As part of the bootcamp in marketing analytics we had one module on design principles and psychological concepts used in marketing. As an outcome, together with 2 colleagues, we created a comprehensive document that covers the main techniques and provides practical examples you might use in your own marketing strategies. From universal Gestalt principles to conversion-centred design, we covered it all so you can understand your customer better.

# web-data-protection-in-germany-factsheet
This is a page with a factsheet covering major info-points to protect your web-related data when located in Germany. 

Hi again!

<b>Why this fact sheet is here?</b></br>
As part of the bootcamp in marketing analytics we had one module on User Privacy and Data Protection. As an outcome, we needed to produce an overview of some practices  


As an outcome, together with 2 colleagues, we created a comprehensive document that covers the main techniques and provides practical examples you might use in your own marketing strategies. From universal Gestalt principles to conversion-centred design, we covered it all so you can understand your customer better.
